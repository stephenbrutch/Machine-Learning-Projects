Will go over machine learning projects

## 1 Bluebook Bulldozer time series cost prediction
Go to [here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/end-to-end-bulldozer-price-regression.ipynb) for an end to end bulldozer price regression model where we look at time series data of bulldozer sales along with all their features in order to best predic the prices and use various data cleaning techiniques and various SciKit-Learn estimators for price predictions.

## 2 Heart Disease Classification
Go to [here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb) for an end to end heart disease classification project on the heart disease dataset from UCI. We also perform some exploratory data analysis and use various SciKit-Learn estimators for heart disease predictions.

## 3 Dog Vision
Go to [here](https://gist.github.com/stephenbrutch/2981dfd244852d8e0c08a9eccbdb2323) for a github gist of a code written for multiclass dog classification using TensorFlow. The dataset is large so initial results are obtained training on a portion of the dataset otherwise even on a GPU the model trains up to 1.5-2 hours. For this model we utilize transfer learning where we take the prebuilt model "mobilenet-v2" and append an extra output layer for our multi class problem. We work to batch/unbatch the data and use neural network architectures for the purpose of multi class classification. We also work to visualize our predictions.

*All that needs to be done is that and to test sample test images to see the models capabilities*

## 4 MNIST classification
Go to [here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/hand_written_mnist_digits_classification.ipynb) for code written for MNIST hand written digits for multi class classification. We use TensorFlow and neural networks for this purpose.

## 5 BTC Price Prediction
Go to [here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/10_time_series_forecasting_in_tensorflow.ipynb) for Bitcoin price prediction handled as a time series forecasting problem. We use the univariate and multivariate case as well as Dense, LSTM, CNN layers using Keras TensorFlow modeling.
