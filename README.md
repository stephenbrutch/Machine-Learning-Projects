# Machine-Learning-Projects
Will go over machine learning projects

## 1 Bluebook Bulldozer time series cost prediction
Go to [here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/end-to-end-bulldozer-price-regression.ipynb) for an end to end bulldozer price regression model where we look at time series data of bulldozer sales along with all their features in order to best predic the prices

## 2 Heart Disease Classification
Go to [here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb) for an end to end heart disease classification project on the heart disease dataset from UCI. We also perform some exploratory data analysis

## 3 Dog Vision
Go to [here](https://gist.github.com/stephenbrutch/2981dfd244852d8e0c08a9eccbdb2323) for a github gist of a code written for multiclass dog classification using TensorFlow. The dataset is large so initial results are obtained training on a portion of the dataset otherwise even on a GPU the model trains up to 1.5-2 hours. All that needs to be done is that and to test sample test images to see the models capabilities

## 4 MNIST classification
Go to [here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/hand_written_mnist_digits_classification.ipynb) for code written for MNIST hand written digits for multi class classification
